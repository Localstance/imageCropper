<h1>Image cropper tool</h1>

<h2>To start working with application, please perform next steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Run <code>npm install</code> in the root of project.</li>
  <li>Run <code>npm start</code> in the command line.
    Now the server is running on <a href="http://localhost:3001" title="server">http://localhost:3001</a></li>
  <li>Have fun :)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Future desirable updates:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add temporary storing of cropped images (think it's possible with comparison of timestamps that I add to the image names).</li>
  <li>Provide user with delete button.</li>
  <li>To deal with quality and image resolutions.</li>
  <li>..and much more..</li>
</ul>
